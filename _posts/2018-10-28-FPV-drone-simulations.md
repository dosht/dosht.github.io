Let's explore the world of simulators and find a good that will help us most to start programming autonmous drones.
I will list a few possible alternative simulations with some pros and cons.
Some of them are build for research purposes like [AirSim](https://github.com/Microsoft/AirSim) from Microsoft
and some of them were build to train pilots of FPV racing drones like [DRL  Simulator](https://store.steampowered.com/app/641780/The_Drone_Racing_League_Simulator).
In this post I will list only simulators that were build for research, however, the other simulators can help too, but will require extra effort for integration.
